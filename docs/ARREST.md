# Arrests

Arresting (setting a status) is done via the `%arrest` command

Syntax: `%arrest id` where ID is the ID of the person you want to arrest.

Arresting someone sets their status in the citizen database to `imprisoned`.

To release someone (resetting a status) is done via the `%release` command

Syntax: `%release id` where ID is the ID of the person you want to release.

Releasing someone removes their `imprisoned` status in the citizen database.
